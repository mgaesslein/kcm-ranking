## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Docker Deployment

### Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and pushes Docker images to:
- **Docker Hub**: `yourusername/kcm-ranking`
- **GitHub Container Registry**: `ghcr.io/mgaesslein/kcm-ranking`

Images are automatically built when:
- You push to the `main` branch (tagged as `latest`)
- You create a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- You create a pull request (build only, no push)

#### Setting Up Automated Builds

1. **Create a Docker Hub account** at https://hub.docker.com

2. **Generate a Docker Hub Access Token**:
   - Go to Account Settings → Security → New Access Token
   - Give it a name (e.g., "GitHub Actions")
   - Copy the token

3. **Add GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret" and add:
     - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
     - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token

4. **Push your code** and the workflow will automatically build and push the image!

#### Pulling Pre-built Images

Your friend can pull the latest image:

```bash
# From Docker Hub
docker pull yourusername/kcm-ranking:latest

# Or from GitHub Container Registry
docker pull ghcr.io/mgaesslein/kcm-ranking:latest

# Run it
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name kcm-ranking yourusername/kcm-ranking:latest
```

### Building the Docker Image Manually

Build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t kcm-ranking:latest .
```

### Running the Docker Container

Run the container and map it to port 8080 (or any port you prefer):

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name kcm-ranking kcm-ranking:latest
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Docker Commands

**Stop the container:**
```bash
docker stop kcm-ranking
```

**Start the container:**
```bash
docker start kcm-ranking
```

**Remove the container:**
```bash
docker rm kcm-ranking
```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker logs kcm-ranking
```

**Rebuild and restart:**
```bash
docker stop kcm-ranking
docker rm kcm-ranking
docker build -t kcm-ranking:latest .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name kcm-ranking kcm-ranking:latest
```

### Docker Compose (Optional)

You can also use Docker Compose. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  kcm-ranking:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Player Aliases Configuration

If players appear in tournaments with different name variations (e.g., "Max" vs "Max Müller"), you can configure aliases to merge them into a single player.

Edit `src/config/playerAliases.js`:

```javascript
export const playerAliases = {
  'Max': 'Max Müller',
  'M. Müller': 'Max Müller',
  'Sarah': 'Sarah Weber',
  'S. Weber': 'Sarah Weber',
}
```

For detailed instructions, see [PLAYER_ALIASES_GUIDE.md](PLAYER_ALIASES_GUIDE.md)

## Data Format

The application expects JSON files in the `/dummy_data` directory with the following structure:

```json

  "_id": "tournament-id",
  "name": "20251119",
  "createdAt": "2025-11-19T17:31:25.537Z",
